# Stock_Price_Prediction_LSTM
# LSTM Stock Price Prediction (MSFT)

This project utilizes a Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) neural network to predict the closing price of Microsoft (MSFT) stock based on historical data.

## Overview

* **Problem:** Predicting future stock prices for decision-making.
* **Approach:** LSTM recurrent neural network to model time-series patterns in stock data.
* **Dataset:** Historical MSFT stock prices downloaded from Yahoo Finance.

## Getting Started

### Dependencies
* pandas
* NumPy
* matplotlib
* scikit-learn (optional, if used for further preprocessing)
* TensorFlow

### Installation

```bash
pip install pandas numpy matplotlib scikit-learn tensorflow
```


## Usage

Download: Clone or download this repository.

Data: Obtain your historical MSFT stock data from Yahoo Finance stock price history and place the CSV file in the Stock_Price_Prediction_LSTM
/MSFT.csv.

Run: Execute the main Python script Stock_Price_Prediction_LSTM.ipynb.

## Results
